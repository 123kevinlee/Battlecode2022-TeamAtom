# Battlecode 2021 

This is my submission for MIT's Battlecode 2022 competition under the team `Atom`.

### Project Structure

The `Compiled Robots/` folder contains every version I compiled and submitted to the scrimmage servers/tournaments.
  
The `src/` folder contains my raw code for the different robots (including a few old robots as test bots) I made throughout the competition.
- My final submission was `atom`, which was submitted to the US tournament and placed 26th.
   
The rest of the files are used to run the client and were provided by the competition developers.

### Useful Commands

- `./gradlew run`
    Runs a game with the settings in gradle.properties
- `./gradlew update`
    Update to the newest version! Run every so often
- `./gradlew --stop`
    Kills running daemons
